## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Franklin â€” an AI/Data Engineer based in the Netherlands. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and learning new languages!

My primary programming language is Python, though over the years Iâ€™ve explored a variety of others â€” from C++ to Prolog â€” through university courses and professional experience. I have an academic background in AI and Data Science.

Professionally, Iâ€™ve worked as an AI/Data Engineer with a strong focus on building and experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications â€” back when the field was just beginning to take off! Iâ€™ve worked with frameworks like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, and DSPy, diving deep into the fast-evolving world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their real-world applications.

My tooling experience spans across Redshift, Azure, and Databricks for data and infrastructure, and Iâ€™ve primarily used Azure DevOps for deployment workflows. You could say Iâ€™ve explored a wide range of tools and approaches to help unlock the full potential of these powerful statistical models.

ðŸ”­ Currently sharpening my skills through small AI/DA projects
ðŸŒ± Learning how to effectively define and manage AI projects
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm writing this while backpacking through Asia!
